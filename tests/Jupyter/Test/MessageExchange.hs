This module serves as one mechanism of testing @jupyter@'s Client functionality, as well as kernels 
included with this project.

This module allows defining a list of 'MessageExchange' values, which indicate a complete message exchange
that should happen between a client and a kernel. The 'testMessageExchange' function then takes the list of
exchanges, runs them using the 'Client' interface, and verifies that all replies (and generated kernel
requests and outputs) match the expected ones.
