The 'Jupyter.Kernel' module provides an API for quickly and easily creating Jupyter kernels.

Jupyter kernels are programs which communicate using the
<https://jupyter-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/messaging.html Jupyter messaging spec>; most kernels
are language backends that allow using a particular programming language with Jupyter frontends such as
the <http://jupyter.org/ notebook> or <http://jupyter.org/qtconsole/stable/ QtConsole>.

To run a kernel, call the 'serve' function, which provides a type-safe implementation of the Jupyter
messaging spec.

More information about the client and kernel interfaces can be found on the @jupyter@
<https://github.com/gibiansky/jupyter-haskell README>, and several example kernels may be found in 
the <https://github.com/gibiansky/jupyter-haskell/tree/master/examples examples> directory.

-- | Indefinitely serve a kernel on the provided ports. If the ports are not open, fails with an
-- exception.
--
-- This starts several threads which listen and write to ZeroMQ sockets on the ports indicated in
-- the 'KernelProfile'. If an exception is raised and any of the threads die, the exception is
-- re-raised on the main thread.
--
-- Using this function generally requires a bit of setup. The most common pattern for use is as follows:
--
-- 1. In your kernel @Main.hs@, parse command line arguments. Some combination of arguments should include
-- a path to a connection file; this file can be read and parsed into a 'KernelProfile' with 'readProfile'.
-- (Often, the same executable will have a different mode that installs the kernel
-- using 'Jupyter.Install.installKernelspec').
-- 2. Set up any state your kernel may need, storing it in an 'Control.Concurrent.MVar' or 'Data.IORef.IORef'.
-- 3. Define your 'CommHandler' and 'ClientRequestHandler' handlers, which read from the state and reply
-- with any necessary messages. (These handlers /may/ be called concurrently from different threads!)
-- 4. Provide the kernel profile and handlers to the 'serve' function, which blocks indefinitely.
--
-- Example kernels may be found in the
-- <https://github.com/gibiansky/jupyter-haskell/tree/master/examples examples> directory.

-- | Indefinitely serve a kernel on some ports. Ports are allocated dynamically and so, unlike

-- The ports allocated by 'serveDynamic' are passed to the provided callback in the 'KernelProfile'
-- so that clients may connect to the served kernel.

-- After the callback is run, several threads are started which listen and write to ZeroMQ sockets
-- on the allocated ports. If an exception is raised and any of the threads die, the exception is
-- re-raised on the main thread. Otherwise, this listens on the kernels indefinitely after running
-- the callback.
--
-- This function serves as a form of inverting control over the allocated ports: usually, clients
-- will choose what ports to listen on, and provide the kernel with the ports with a connection file
-- path in the kernel command-line arguments. With this function, you can instead first start the
