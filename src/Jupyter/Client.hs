This module serves as the primary interface to Jupyter clients, as provided by the @jupyter@ library.

Communication with clients is done in the 'Client' monad, which is a thin wrapper over 'IO' which 
maintains a small bit of required state to identify a running kernel and the sockets on which to 
communicate with it. The initial state and connection information is supplied when you use 'runClient',
which requires connection information and the 'Client' action to run.

The 'runClient' function also requires a set of 'ClientHandlers', which are callbacks that get called
when the kernel sends any sort of message to the client ('KernelRequest's, 'KernelOutput's, and 'Comm's).

These functions can be used quite succinctly to communicate with external clients. For example, the
following code connects to an installed Python kernel (the @ipykernel@ package msut be installed):

@
import Jupyter.Client

main :: IO ()
main = 
  'runClient' Nothing Nothing handlers $ \profile -> do
    -- The `profile` provided is a generated 'KernelProfile'
    -- that the client will connect to. Start an IPython kernel
    -- that listens on that profile.
    liftIO $ do
      'writeProfile' profile "profile.json"
      'System.Process.spawnProcess' "python" ["-m", "ipykernel", "-f", "profile.json"]

    -- Find out info about the kernel by sending it a kernel info request.
    reply <- 'sendClientRequest' 'KernelInfoRequest'
    liftIO $ print reply
@

More information about the client and kernel interfaces can be found on the @jupyter@ <https://github.com/gibiansky/jupyter-haskell README>.
